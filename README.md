Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner) 

● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables. 

● You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool 

● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data 

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day? 

● Sample Solution : https://bit.ly/2HxiGGJ  

Supervised machine learning 


Supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning in which the machine is fed the training data which is labelled. 
Supervised machine learning is further categorized into regression and classification Linear regression is probably the simplest approach for statistical learning. 
It is a good starting point for more advanced approaches, and in fact, many fancy statistical learning techniques can be seen as an extension of l
inear regression. Therefore, understanding this simple model will build a good base before moving on to more complex approaches.Output type- continuous (number)
